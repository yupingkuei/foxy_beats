# Foxy Beats
"Foxy Beats" was a 1 week group project during my time at Le Wagon Tokyo. The concept of the app was to create an airbnb-esc, marketplace web-app.<br>
We decided to build an online vinyl rental service and go for the 70s retro design. The idea is to try out the vinyl before you committed to it. Share your taste and explore more!
